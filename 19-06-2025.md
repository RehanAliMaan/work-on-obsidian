## Notes  
## Comparison between github,gitlab and bitbucket

GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket are the three most popular Git repository services, known for their version control, security, and supportive communities.

[GitHub] is the most popular, with an active community of 100 million developers. It hosts over 420 million repositories, making it a favorite for open-source projects, with 28 million public repositories. It also provides robust CI/CD pipelines.

[GitLab] is similar, providing hosting for code repositories. It provides a broader range of DevOps tools than its competitors, including security testing and monitoring.

[BitBucket] is more specialized. It’s the native Git tool in Atlassian’s Open DevOps solution. It’s primarily a code repository, tailored for Jira and Confluence integrations and software projects.

## Github Main features
Some of the main reasons why GitHub is so popular is because it offers repository branching and forking, lets you clone an entire codebase, and use both pull and merge requests. 

#### **Ownership**

Development on GitHub started in 2007. It was originally launched by three software developers as a flat organization with no middle management whatsoever. It was a fully bootstrapped company. 

By 2012, Microsoft was hosting most of its projects on GitHub, including some of its biggest open-source projects such as .NET Core, MSBuild, PowerShell, and Visual Studio Code. In 2018, the company decided to purchase GitHub for $7.5 billion.

#### **Speed**

It’s also incredibly fast, resolving requests quickly, and allowing developers to upload files to different repositories. GitHub is free to use for all personal accounts, and they made private repositories free for unlimited collaborators too. 

#### **Simplified Project Management**

GitHub offers support for kanban boards to help you structure and streamline your software development workflow. It also lets developers quickly synchronize merged versions, resolve issues, and track changes more conveniently.

#### **Integrations and Language Support**

Currently, GitHub supports more than 200 programming languages, and because it’s so popular in the developer community, it also has dedicated integrations available for popular platforms such as Google Cloud, Windows Azure, Asana, AWS, and others. 

#### **Popularity**

GitHub is by far the most popular version control system in use today. It has certain features that you won’t find in BitBucket, such as syntax highlighting, and GitHub Pages, which lets you host sites on GitHub only. 

#### **Support**

Again, owing to its popularity, support from the GitHub community is massive. You can find guides, tutorials, and extensive documentation about virtually anything you’d want to know about the platform.
## *GitLab

Now, let’s talk about GitLab and how it sets itself apart from the competition.

#### **Ownership**

GitLab was founded by alumni from the Winter 2015 batch of the Y Combinator seed programme. It was built around the software project of the same name and was originally launched by two developers in Ukraine. 

The company raised seed funding from Khosla Ventures $4 million in September 2015. Another $20 million followed from August Capital in the subsequent year. And, in 2021, GitLab Inc., its parent company, had its IPO on NASDAQ.

#### **Compliance Control**

One of the major benefits of using GitLab is that it comes with compliance control built in. It runs security scans automatically and has compliance pipelines to ensure that standards are imposed on the entire codebase. 

#### **Managing Permissions**

GitLab lets you define and modify permissions for individuals based on their roles. You can also attach files to specific issues, which isn’t possible with GitHub.

#### **Issue Tracking**

GitLab’s administration solutions are designed to help software developers trace issues throughout the lifecycle of the project. Users can create new issues using the Issue Board, and assign them to team members. 

#### **GitLab Flow**

GitLab Flow is a Continuous Integration (CI) tool that lets users automate code testing using various tools. It’s a great way to ensure that your code remains free of any bugs or major issues. 

### *Bitbucket



Bitbutcket is the oldest tool on this list and is used by many software development companies. Here are some key differentiators. 

#### **Ownership**

Bitbucket was launched as an independent company in 2008, working primarily with Mercurial Projects. In 2010 however, Atlassian acquired the company. Today, Bitbucket is a key part of Atlassian’s software offering.

#### **Integrations**

One of the things that sets Bitbucket apart from the rest is how seamlessly it integrates with tools like Jira, an issue-tracking software. This was also developed by Atlassian, and so unsurprisingly Bitbucket integrates perfectly with Jira to improve version control and bug tracking. 

#### **Code Review**

When you send a pull request in Bitbucket, it shows the test results of security scans directly in a visual format, making it easier for users to analyze the code. Everything’s presented on one page, which reduces back-and-forth.

#### **Source Control**

Developers can easily track changes to the source files of a project, which makes it easy to determine what stage of the project the team is at. This also makes it easier for distributed teams to collaborate with others.

#### **REST APIs**

Bitbucket offers REST APIs that make it easy for developers to start building third-party apps using different programming languages. 

#### **Code Snippets**

Developers can share code snippets and files with each other, allowing them to quickly get feedback and resolve issues

# Sementic Versioning:
# Introduction to Semantic Versioning

Semantic versioning (also known as **SemVer**) is a versioning system that has been on the rise over the last few years. It has always been a problem for software developers, release managers and consumers. Having a universal way of versioning the software development projects is the best way to track what is going on with the software as new plugins, addons, libraries and extensions are being built almost every day. This problem can be solved by Semantic Versioning. In brief, it's a way for numbering the software releases.  
  
So, SemVer is in the form of **Major.Minor.Patch**.   
 

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/semver.png)

Different components of version numbering

Semantic Versioning is a 3-component number in the format of X.Y.Z, where :  

- **X** stands for a **major version**. The leftmost number denotes a major version. When you increase the major version number, you increase it by one but you reset both patch version and minor versions to zero. If the current version is 2.6.9 then the next upgrade for a major version will be 3.0.0. Increase the value of X when breaking the existing API.
- **Y** stands for a **minor version**. It is used for the release of new functionality in the system. When you increase the minor version, you increase it by one but you must reset the patch version to zero. If the current version is 2.6.9 then the next upgrade for a minor version will be 2.7.0. Increase the value of Y when implementing new features in a backward-compatible way.
- **Z** stands for a **Patch Versions:** Versions for patches are used for bug fixes. There are no functionality changes in the patch version upgrades. If the current version is 2.6.9 then the next version for a patch upgrade will be 2.6.10. There is no limit to these numbers. Increase the value of Z when fixing bugs
